Required contents of a backup medium:
- data itself

It should also contain enough metadata to re-create the rules from which it was created in case the master config is lost and only the backups exist.
Actually, that's not the most important one. The really important one is enough metadata to re-create the database of things backed up (fingerprints for volatile files etc.)

It will probably also require a directory of some sort. Might be the same as the metadata above, or different.


#
A file can be STABLE (its content doesn't change: if it's on a backup, it doesn't need to go on a new one; e.g. photos) or VOLATILE (its content changes, and an existing backup can contain an out-of-date version; e.g. documents).


#
Basic components:
- ruleset for which files to backup, and their category (stable vs. volatile)
- database of existing backup media:
	- what's stored on them
	- creation date
	- information about the contents of volatile files on them, for purpose of out-of-date checks. These could be file size, hash, and other data.
- process of creating a new backup medium
